# Developer Productivity Tips

## 1) Plan Before Coding
- Sketch out ideas (Figma, iPad, paper)
- Use V0 for mockups (10-15 prompts minimum)
	- https://v0.dev/
- Set your AI assistant up for success  
  *"Half the game is acting like a developer" - Mike*

Basically, we need to provide foundations (boilerplates or structure) on which Cursor to build our project.

## 2) Use `cursor.directory` for Better Prompts
- Copy tech-specific prompts
- Create `.cursor_rules` file in project root
- Drastically improves Cursor's output  
  **Pro tip**: Customize prompts for your exact tech stack
* Reference: https://cursor.directory/
## 3) Tag Relevant Documentation
- Add official docs to Cursor (Next.js, Supabase, etc.)
- Ensures up-to-date, accurate responses
- Cursor reads docs when answering queries

## 4) Ask Other AI Models When Stuck
- Copy errors to Claude, GPT-4, etc.
- Include failed solutions for better context
- Different models can solve problems others can't

## 5) Use AI to Explain Code
- Great for learning & documentation
- Ask to explain like you're a beginner
- Follow up on confusing concepts  
  *"The more you do this, the more you learn patterns" - Mike*

## 6) Leverage Existing Code Templates
- Start with boilerplate (auth, DB, **payments**)
- Build on top of proven foundations
- Saves time on repetitive tasks

## 7) Add Comments to Your Code
- Ask AI to explain & document your code
- Improves readability & understanding
- Great for team collaboration

## 8) Duplicate & Modify Existing Functionality
- Copy working code from other parts of your project
- Ask AI to adapt it for new use cases
- Provides context for better results  
  **Key takeaway**: Give AI as much context as possible for best results!
