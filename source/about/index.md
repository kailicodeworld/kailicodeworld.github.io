Hello there,

Thank you for taking the time to read through my mumbling about all the stuff I don't know. I love to work with data processing and all the big data stacks, e.g. Hadoop ecosystem, Spark, Snowflake, etc. Lately, I am working on my skillsets to become a Machine Learning engineer with a focus on building MLOps pipelines. But first I will try my best to understand what is going on with all the hypes about LLM or Machine Learning in general. If it is really going to make a huge difference in the world, why don't I jump on the bandwagon as well? You bet! I am doing just that.
